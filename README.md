# Duplicate Tabs Defender Chromium Extension

This extension prevents the creation of duplicate tabs. If a url is already present in another tab, it closes the duplicate tab and switches to the already opened tab. The duplication detection scope is one browser window. So if you really want to duplicate a tab, just open it in a new window.
