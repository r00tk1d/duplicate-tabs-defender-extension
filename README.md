# Duplicate Tabs Defender Chromium Extension

This extension prevents the creation of duplicate tabs. If a url (without the url fragment) is already present in another tab, it closes the tab and switches to the tab with the asked url. Tab duplication detection applies to each browser window individually. So if you really want to duplicate a tab, just open it in a new window.
